\item \points{2b} {\bf Dynamic Programming}

Suppose we have an $n\times n$ grid. We start in the upper-left corner (position
$(1,1)$), and we would like to reach the lower-right corner (position $(n,n)$)
by taking single steps down and right. Define a function $c(i, j)$ to be the
cost of touching position $(i, j)$, and assume it takes constant time to
compute. Note that $c(i, j)$ can be negative. Give an algorithm for computing
the minimum cost in the most efficient way. What is the runtime (just give the
big-O)?
