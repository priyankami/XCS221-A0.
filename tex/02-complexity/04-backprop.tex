\item \points{2d} {\bf Complexity}

Consider the scalar-valued function $f(\mathbf w)$ from Problem 1e. Devise a
strategy that first does preprocessing in $O(n d^2)$ time, and then for any
given vector $\mathbf w$, takes $O(d^2)$ time instead to compute $f(\mathbf w)$.

{\em Hint: Refactor the algebraic expression; this is a classic trick used in machine learning. Again, you may find it helpful to work out the scalar case first.}
