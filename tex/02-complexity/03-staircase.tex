\item \points{2c} {\bf Recursion}

Suppose we have a staircase with $n$ steps (we start on the ground, so we need
$n$ total steps to reach the top). We can take as many steps forward at a time,
but we will never step backwards. How many ways are there to reach the top?

Give your answer as a function of $n$. For example: if $n = 3$, then the answer is $4$. The four options are the following:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt,label=\arabic*)]
\item take one step, take one step, take one step
\item take two steps, take one step
\item take one step, take two steps
\item take three steps.
\end{enumerate}
