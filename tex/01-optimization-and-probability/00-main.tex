\item {\bf Optimization and Probability}

In this class, we will cast a lot of AI problems as optimization problems, that is, finding the best solution in a rigorous mathematical sense. At the same time, we must be adroit at coping with uncertainty in the world, and for that, we appeal to tools from probability.
