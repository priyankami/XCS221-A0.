\item \points{1c} {\bf Probability}

Suppose you repeatedly roll a fair six-sided die until you roll a $1$ (and then
you stop). Every time you roll a $2$, you lose $a$ points, and every time you
roll a 6, you win $b$ points. You do not win or lose any points if you roll a 3,
4, or a 5. What is the expected number of points (as a function of $a$ and $b$)
you will have when you stop?

{\em Hint: We recommend defining a recurrence.}
