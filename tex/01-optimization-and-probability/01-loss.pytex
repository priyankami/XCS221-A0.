\item \points{1a} {\bf Optimization}

Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be real numbers representing positions on a number line.
Let $w_1, \dots, w_n$ be positive real numbers representing the importance of
each of these positions. Consider the quadratic function:
$f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (\theta - x_i)^2$.
What value of $\theta$ minimizes $f(\theta)$? What problematic issues could
arise if some of the $w_i$'s are negative?

{\em Note: You can think about this problem as trying to find the point $\theta$
that's not too far away from the $x_i$'s. Over time, hopefully you'll appreciate
how nice quadratic functions are to minimize.}
