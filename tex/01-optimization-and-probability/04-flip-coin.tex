\item \points{1d} {\bf Probability}

Suppose the probability of a coin turning up heads is $0 < p < 1$, and that
we flip it 7 times and get $\{ \text{H}, \text{H}, \text{T}, \text{H}, \text{T}
, \text{T}, \text{H}  \}$. We know the probability (likelihood) of obtaining
this sequence is $L(p) = p p (1-p) p (1-p) (1-p) p = p^4(1-p)^3$. What value of
$p$ maximizes $L(p)$?

What is an intuitive interpretation of this value of $p$?

{\em Hint: Consider taking the derivative of $\log L(p)$. You can also directly
take the derivative of $L(p)$, but it is cleaner and more natural to
differentiate $\log L(p)$. You can verify for yourself that the value of $p$
which maximizes $\log L(p)$ must also maximize $L(p)$ (you are not required to
prove this in your solution).}
