{\bf Introduction}

Welcome to your first XCS221 assignment! The goal of this assignment is to
sharpen your math and programming skills needed for this class. If you meet the
prerequisites, you should find these problems relatively innocuous. Some of
these problems will occur again as subproblems of later homeworks, so make sure
you know how to do them.
